    Imagine a school that practices equality. It provides the same textbooks, facilities,
        <br> and teachers to all students. However, some students may have learning disabilities or come from disadvantaged backgrounds
        <br>, making it difficult for them to succeed with only equal resources. On the other hand,<br>
         a school that practices equity would provide additional resources such as tutoring or individualized support to students who need it,
        <br> ensuring that all students have an equal opportunity to thrive academically.
